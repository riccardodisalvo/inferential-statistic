## Project Overview

This project is designed to consolidate the concepts learned in the course of inferential statistics with Excel that I learned in my MA in Data Analytics by generating and analyzing data. The Excel workbook consists of 6 sheets, each dedicated to different aspects of data manipulation and analysis. The dataset simulates the ages of a population and involves statistical operations including sampling, correlation analysis, and linear regression.

### Dataset Description

The dataset simulates the ages of 250 individuals in a fictional population of Luggnagg. The data is generated using a normal distribution with specified parameters.

**Dataset Structure:**
- **Number of Rows:** 250
- **Number of Columns:** 2
- **Columns:**
  - **Age:** The age of the individual.
  - **Group:** A randomly assigned group number from 1 to 4.
